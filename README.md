# Alejandr√≠a Frontend ‚ú®

## What is Alejandr√≠a?

Alejandr√≠a is an innovative web platform designed to foster social interaction in a way similar to Twitter, but with an added value: the integration of artificial intelligence (AI). Through this platform, users can share posts, interact with each other, and also leverage the power of language models (LLMs) in the chat to make queries based on the information generated within the platform. This enables searches that are personalized and based on the users‚Äô own data, creating a rich and tailored experience.

In addition to social functionalities, Alejandr√≠a features a marketplace section where users can exchange products or services, making it a comprehensive space for both social interaction and digital commerce.

Alejandr√≠a was developed from scratch, starting with the architectural design, followed by the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) development, including both frontend and backend, cloud deployment, and integration with an application packager for distribution in the Play Store. In this repository, you will specifically find the code for the frontend of this project.
